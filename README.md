# laqach
A blockchain powered crowd funding platform.

#  TODO
- redo project structre
- interface instead of library for each CC conversion class and CC funding class
-  user account creation for the one being funded
- No need for account creation for funders
- store all accounts of funders, how?
- transfer crypto to fund people
- the MVP shouldn't need more than:
  - A dashboard reflecting various crowd funding campaigns. A user can have multiple.
    - detailed view should give info like money gathered thus far
    - start and expiration date. set a max runtime for each campaign.
  - each campaign should have a custom link that leads to a single page that doesn't need login for people to send crypto
  - Support ETH and BITCOIN first and then other CCs.
  - support USD and NGN
  - single scripts to handle each CC
  - price converter library
  - the already existing scripts
